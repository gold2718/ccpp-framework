Hello World
===========

Quick start, follow these steps:
```
cd <ccpp_framework>/doc/HelloWorld
mkdir build
cd build
make -f ../Makefile
./HelloWorld
```

The `make` step performs the following steps:
 1. Run `ccpp_capgen.py` to generate CCPP framework interface files
 2. Compile source and files generated by the `ccpp_capgen` and create
HelloWorld

 1. The `ccpp_capgen.py` step looks like:
```
../../../scripts/ccpp_capgen.py                                       \
        --host-files ../hello_world_host.meta,../hello_world_mod.meta \
        --scheme-files ../hello_scheme.meta,../temp_adjust.meta       \
        --suites ../hello_world_suite.xml --generate-host-cap
```
This produces the following files:
 * **HelloWorld_ccpp_cap.F90**: The CCPP interface functions to be called by
the host model.
 * **ccpp_hello_world_suite_cap.F90**: The suite file which contains the
subroutines which execute each phase of the `hello_world_suite` physics
suite. In general, there is one cap file per suite definition file.
 * **ccpp_kinds.F90**: A module which defines common types such as
`kind_phys` which are used by both host models and CCPP physics schemes.
 * **capfiles.txt**: A file which lists all of the files generated by
the call to `ccpp_capgen.py` (except for capfiles.txt). This file can be used
in CMake (by including it in your CMakeLists.txt) or make (by including it
in your Makefile as shown in this example).
